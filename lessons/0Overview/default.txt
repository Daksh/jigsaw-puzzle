Jigsaw Puzzle: Lesson Plans Overview

The Jigsaw Puzzle is an important tool in helping students visually construct a picture.  It allows students to construct a picture by building on their visual, spacial and problem solving skills.  It also offers a context to explore many different subjects. 

The Jigsaw Puzzle provides a fun context for learners (and beginning XO users) and encourages them to explore basic functions of the XO laptop.  

Throughout the school year, the Jigsaw Puzzle can be integrated into different subject areas (i.e. geography, math and language arts).  Students can make the Jigsaw Puzzle images relate to a subject the class is studying, and share them with peers. In the process they will also learn how to use and integrate the output from XO Paint program, Record, Mesh Network, and other tools.
