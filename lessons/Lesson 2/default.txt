Lesson 2: How to Read a Map 

	If there is an accessible map of the country you live in, put that up in the classroom. Or download a map from the Internet to look at on your XO Laptops.

	Discuss with your class some of the following questions:
	What are the geographical boundaries of your country?  
	Who are the neighboring countries?  
	How does your country compare in size to the neighboring countries?  
	Are there rivers in your country?  
	Are there mountain ranges in your country?  

	Look at the Map key.  Discuss what certain symbols on the map mean.  For instance, a star shows where the capital of the country is located.  

	Point out the map compass which will show North, South, East and West and explain how it can be used to locate items on the map.  

	Discuss what purpose a map serves.  How do they help people understand a country better?  One student can record these ideas on their XO Laptop using the Write activity.
