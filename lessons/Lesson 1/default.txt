Lesson 1:  Exploring the Jigsaw Puzzle Activity 

	 From the Home screen of your XO, click on the Jigsaw Puzzle icon. You can also open it from the MaMaMedia Creative Center activity.

	Pick the subject of pictures you would like to solve.  As an example, you can pick birds and then you have a choice to pick puzzles with pictures of birds on them.
 
	Double click on the picture you would like to solve.  The picture will be broken into small pieces for you to reassemble.

	Click and drag a puzzle piece into the solving square.  Once you have dragged all the pieces to the correct places, it will become a seamless picture.

	Explore the puzzle options â€“ change the shapes and the number of the puzzle pieces.  You can click on Solve and the entire picture will appear.  You can click on Hint and an outline of the puzzle pieces will appear in the solving box.  Clear permits you to start again.

	On the right hand side of the screen, you have the option to click on My Picture.  You can import a picture you took with your camera or you can paint a picture and create your own puzzle image.  Take time to explore how this feature works.

	Work in pairs or independently to solve a few puzzles, and then walk around and work and help others who are still solving their puzzles. Share problem-solving strategies.
