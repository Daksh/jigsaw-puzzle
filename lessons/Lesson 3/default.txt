Lesson 3: Map Jigsaw Puzzles  

	Once you are familiar with the map of your country, try to find that map (or one of another place you are interested in) on the Internet and download it. Try using Google Maps and other free map services. 

	If you do not have Internet access, try painting a map with the Paint tool on your XO laptop, or taking a picture of a wall map with the XO’s Record activity. 

	Take your new map image and import it into the Jigsaw puzzle activity to create a map puzzle for other students to solve.  

	From the Home screen of your XO, click on the Jigsaw Puzzle icon to open it. You can also open the Jigsaw Puzzle activity from the MaMaMedia Activity Center. 

	Click on the “My Picture” button. A window showing a list of the things saved in your Journal will appear. Look for the saved picture or photo you want to make into a puzzle and click on it. The image you chose from the Journal will appear in the Jigsaw Puzzle.

	Choose the “Share with my Neighborhood" button at the top of your screen so others can access your map image through the Mesh.

	Go to the Mesh view and click on a Jigsaw puzzle that another student is sharing. Once it loads on your laptop, you can try to solve it toghether with your friend!

	Once you solve a map puzzle, tell the group what country or place it is.
